    <h3>How to Cook Egg Fried Rice</h3>
    <p>Making egg fried rice is as easy as tossing all your ingredients together literally! Begin by cracking 4 eggs and placing them in a bowl. Then, after heating some oil in a wok, pour them in, cooking them until the side on the pan turns brown and somewhat crispy. Turn the eggs over, doing the same to the other side. Your peppers, both bell peppers and sweet peppers, go in next, as do you onions. Sauté the ingredients for a minute while breaking the eggs apart. Next, add in half of your leftover rice, stir frying for about 2 minutes. Add the rest of your rice in, and continue cooking and tossing until you’ve incorporated all of your ingredients well.</p>
    <p>Make your egg fried rice smell—and taste—even better by adding sesame oil and soy sauce. For 2 minutes, stir fry your rice even further, then add salt, sugar, and your green onions. Toss your egg fried rice one last time, before turning the heat off the stove and transferring it to a serving plate.</p>
